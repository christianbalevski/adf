# Releasing ADF Studio

The version lives in `package.json`. **Never hand-edit it** — `npm version`
bumps it, makes the commit, and creates the matching `vX.Y.Z` git tag in one
atomic step. A `postversion` hook then pushes the commit + tag for you, and
pushing the tag triggers CI to build and publish all platforms.

## The whole release — one command

From a clean `main` (all feature/fix work already merged):

```bash
npm version patch        # 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2  (commit "0.1.2" + tag v0.1.2)
                         # postversion hook auto-runs: git push --follow-tags
```

- `patch` = bug fixes (0.1.1 → 0.1.2)
- `minor` = backward-compatible features (0.1.1 → 0.2.0)
- `major` = breaking changes (0.1.1 → 1.0.0)

That's it. Pushing the `v0.1.2` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

1. **build** (matrix) — `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`, `ubuntu-latest` each
   run `npm run release`, building their OS's installer and uploading it to a
   single **draft** GitHub Release for the tag.
2. **publish** — once *all three* succeed, flips the draft to a published
   release. Downloads go live at
   `https://github.com/christianbalevski/adf/releases/latest`.

If any platform's build fails, the `publish` job is skipped and the release
stays an unpublished draft — users never see a release missing a platform. Fix
the cause and re-push the tag (`git push --delete origin vX.Y.Z` then re-tag),
or just cut the next patch.

`npm version` refuses to run on a dirty working tree — that's intentional. A
release is a clean, deliberate point.

> Version bumps are **not** per-commit. Normal work commits stay unversioned;
> you only run `npm version` when you actually cut a build.

## Watching / re-running a release

```bash
gh run watch                              # follow the in-progress release run
gh run list --workflow=release.yml        # history
gh run rerun <run-id>                     # retry after a flaky failure
```

The draft (or published release) is visible the whole time on the repo's
**Releases** page.

## Building locally (testing only)

You normally never do this — CI owns real releases. To smoke-test a packaged
build on your machine:

```bash
npm run package                           # builds into dist/, does NOT publish
```

To test the publish path itself, `GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) npm run release`
uploads to a draft from your machine — but it only attaches *your* OS's
installer, so let CI produce real multi-platform releases.

## Code signing (not configured)

CI builds are **unsigned** (`CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY: false`). macOS users
get a Gatekeeper warning on first open (right-click → Open). Adding an Apple
Developer cert + notarization, and a Windows signing cert, is the next
hardening step — wire the certs in as GitHub secrets and electron-builder picks
them up automatically.
